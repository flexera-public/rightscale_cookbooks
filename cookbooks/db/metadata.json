  "long_description": "= RightScale Database Manager\n\n== DESCRIPTION:\n\nThis cookbook provides a set of database recipes used by the RightScale \nDatabase Manager ServerTemplates.\n\nThis cookbook does not contain a specific database implementation, rather \nit provides an interface for general database actions and parameters.\n\n\n== DETAILS:\n\n=== General\nThe 'db' interface is defined by a Lightweight Resource, which can be found in\nthe resources/default.rb file.\n\nThis cookbook is intended to be used in conjunction with cookbooks that contain\nLightweight Providers which implement the 'db' interface. See the RightScale \ndb_mysql cookbook for an example.\n\nFor more about Lightweight Resources and Providers (LWRPs), please see the Chef\nwiki at:\n  \n  http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Lightweight+Resources+and+Providers+%28LWRP%29\n  \n=== Backup/Restore\nThis cookbook depends on the block_device LWRP for backup and restore \nactions.  See db::do_backup and db::do_restore recipes for examples.  The \nblock_device cookbook in RightScale's cookbooks_premium repository\nprovides primary and secondary persistence solutions for multiple clouds.\n\nHowever, using LWRPs one can provide their own block_device implementation\ninstead.  \n\nPlease see RightScale's premium block_device cookbook for the list of \navailable actions, attributes and usage.\n\n      \n== REQUIREMENTS:\n\n* Must be used with a 'db' provider in the cookbook path.\n* Depends on a 'block_device' resource for backup and restore recipes. \n\n     \n== SETUP:\n   \n* Place db::default recipe into your runlist to setup the db resource.  When\n  using a RightScale ServerTemplate, this will also automatically add the \n  common database attributes to your ServerTemplate inputs.\n   \n* The default recipe for the cookbook that contains the db provider must also\n  be added to your runlist. For example:\n  \n    db_mysql::default \n    \n  This will load your provider and pull in any database specific attributes \n  as inputs.\n\n== USAGE:\n\n=== Initialize a master database:\n\n1. Once your VMs is operational, run the:\n   \n    \"db::setup_block_device\"\n    \n   recipe. This will initialize your database onto a block device\n   that supports backup and restore operations. \n2. Initialize your database from previous dumpfile or other source.\n3. Register your database with a Dynamic DNS provider using:\n#TODO update to reflect DNS changes made\n\n    \"sys_dns::do_set_private\"\n   \n   to allow you application servers to start making connections.\n4. Backup your database using:\n\n    \"db:do_backup\"\n    \n   to allow restoring the master database in case of failure or\n   planned termination.\n   \n=== Restore a master database:\n\n1. Once your VMs is operational, run the:\n   \n    \"db::do_restore\"\n    \n   recipe. This will restore your database from a backup previously saved to\n   persistent cloud storage. \n3. Register your database with a Dynamic DNS provider using:\n\n    \"sys_dns::do_set_private\"\n   \n   to allow you application servers to start making connections.\n\n\n== KNOWN LIMITATIONS:\n\n* Currently only one db provider should be present in your cookbook path.\n* The 'appserver_allow' and 'appserver_deny' recipes require VMs managed \n  by the RightScale platform to run.\n  \n   \n== PROVIDERS:\n\nWhen writing your own database Lightweight Provider:\n\n* The database provider to use is defined by node[:db][:provider] attribute, \n  you will need to override this. You can do so by adding: \n   \n    set[:db][:provider] = \"db_myprovider\"\n    \n  in the attributes file of your provider cookbook.\n  \n* Any database specific attributes that you wish to make user configurable \n  should be added to the cookbook metadata with the default recipe included in\n  the attribute's 'recipes' array.  For more about Chef metadata, please see\n  the Chef wiki at:\n  \n    http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Metadata\n   \n* Your provider cookbook metadata should depend on this cookbook by\n  added a 'depends' line to your metadata. For example:\n  \n    depends \"db\"\n    \n\n\n= LICENSE\n\nCopyright RightScale, Inc. All rights reserved.

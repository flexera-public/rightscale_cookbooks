  "long_description": "# RightScale Database Cookbook\n\n## DESCRIPTION:\n\nThis cookbook is available at [https://github.com/rightscale/rightscale_cookbooks](https://github.com/rightscale/rightscale_cookbooks).\n\nThis cookbook provides a set of database recipes used by the RightScale\nDatabase Manager ServerTemplates.\n\nThis cookbook does not contain a specific database implementation, rather\nit provides an interface for general database actions and parameters.\n\n## REQUIREMENTS:\n\n* Must be used with a 'db' provider in the cookbook path.\n* Depends on a `block_device` resource for backup and restore recipes.\n* Requires a virtual machine launched from a RightScale-managed RightImage.\n\n## COOKBOOKS DEPENDENCIES:\n\nPlease see `metadata.rb` file for the latest dependencies.\n\n## KNOWN LIMITATIONS:\n\n* Only one db provider should be present in your cookbook path.\n\n## SETUP:\n\n* To setup only the database client, place `db::default` recipe into\n  your runlist. This will pull in generic client inputs, provide provider\n  selection input and install client. Set db/provider_type input in\n  RightScale ServerTemplate to set provider and version for 'db' resource.\n  Packages specific to the database for application servers will be installed by\n  the `install_client_driver` action of the db_<provider> based on the type\n  of driver. The driver type should be set by the application servers and\n  passed to the db_<provider> cookbook. This action also sets the\n  `node[:db][:client][:driver]` attribute which is used to perform\n  database specific actions.\n* To setup a database client and server, place the following recipes\n  in order to your runlist:\n\n    db_<provider>::setup_server_<version>\n      loads the database provider, tuning parameters, as well as other\n      provider-specific attributes into the node as inputs.\n\n    db::install_server\n      sets up generic server and client inputs. This will also include\n      db::default recipe which installs the client.\n\n  For example: To set up and install MySQL 5.5 client and server\n\n    db_mysql::setup_server_5_5\n    db::install_server\n\n## USAGE:\n\n### Initialize a master database:\n\n1. Once your server is operational, run the:\n\n    \"db::do_init_and_become_master\"\n\n   recipe, which initializes your database onto a block device\n   that supports backup and restore operations.\n2. Initialize your database from previous dump file or other source.\n3. Register your database with a DNS provider that supports dynamic DNS using:\n\n    \"sys_dns::do_set_private\"\n\n   to allow your application servers to start making connections.\n4. Backup your database using:\n\n    \"db:do_backup\"\n\n   so that you can restore the master database in the event \n   of a failure or planned termination.\n\n### Restore a master database:\n\n1. Once your server is operational, run the:\n\n    \"db::do_restore\"\n\n   recipe, which restores your database from a backup previously saved to\n   persistent cloud storage.\n2. Register your database with a DNS provider that supports dynamic DNS using:\n\n    \"sys_dns::do_set_private\"\n\n   to allow your application servers to start making connections.\n\n### Setup database client:\n\n1. Put \"db::default\" into database client ServerTemplate runlist.\n   Use db/provider_type input to select from existing clients or override this\n   input to add custom type of database client\n   db/provider_type Input selects your database provider cookbook\n   (e.g. db_mysql, db_postgres, db_oracle, etc.) and what database version the\n   client will connect to. (e.g. 5.1, 5.5, 9.1). This affects what connector\n   package to install. Syntax for this input is\n   <cookbook>_<version> (i.e. db_mydatabase_1.0)\n2. Fill `db/application/password` , `db/application/user` and\n   `db/dns/master/fqdn` inputs which are necessary to connect client to\n   Database Manager.\n\n## DETAILS:\n\n### General\n\nThe 'db' interface is defined by a Lightweight Resource, which can be found in\nthe 'resources/default.rb' file.\n\nThis cookbook is intended to be used in conjunction with cookbooks that contain\nLightweight Providers which implement the 'db' interface. See RightScale's\n'db_mysql' cookbook for an example.\n\nFor more information about Lightweight Resources and Providers (LWRPs), please\nsee: [Lightweight Resources and Providers][LWRP]\n\n[LWRP]: http://support.rightscale.com/12-Guides/Chef_Cookbooks_Developer_Guide/04-Developer/06-Development_Resources/Lightweight_Resources_and_Providers_(LWRP)\n\n### Backup/Restore\n\nThis cookbook depends on the block_device LWRP for backup and restore actions.\nSee `db::do_backup` and `db::do_restore` recipes for examples. The\n'block_device' cookbook provides primary and secondary persistence solutions for\nmultiple clouds.\n\nHowever, using LWRPs one can provide their own block device implementation\ninstead.\n\nPlease see the 'block_device' cookbook for the list of available actions,\nattributes and usage.\n\n### Providers:\n\nWhen writing your own database Lightweight Provider:\n\n* The database provider to use is defined by the `node[:db][:provider]`\n  attribute. You will need to override this attribute by adding the following\n  code in the attributes file of your provider cookbook.\n\n    set[:db][:provider] = \"db_myprovider\"\n\n* Any database-specific attributes that you wish to make into user-configurable\n  inputs should be added to the cookbook metadata with the default recipe included in\n  the attribute's 'recipes' array. For more about Chef metadata, please see:\n  [Chef Metadata][Guide]\n* Your provider cookbook metadata should depend on this cookbook by adding a\n  'depends' line to its metadata. For example:\n\n    depends \"db\"\n\n[Guide]: http://support.rightscale.com/12-Guides/Chef_Cookbooks_Developer_Guide/02-End_User/04-RightScale_Support_of_Chef/Chef_Metadata\n\n## LICENSE:\n\nCopyright RightScale, Inc.

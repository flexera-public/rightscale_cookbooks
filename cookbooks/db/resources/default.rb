#
add_action :stop

# == Start
# Start the database service.
#
# Calls the correct init.d script for the database and platform.
#
add_action :start

# == Status
# Log the status of the database service.
#
# Calls the correct init.d script for the database and platform
# and send the output to the Chef log and RightScale audit entries.
#
add_action :status

# == Lock
# Lock the database so writes will be blocked.
#
# This must insure a consistent state while taking a snapshot.
#
add_action :lock

# == Unlock
# Unlock the database so writes can occur.
#
# This must be called as soon as possible after calling the :lock action
# since no clients will be blocked from writing.
#
add_action :unlock

# == Reset
# Wipes the current database into a pristine state.
#
# This utility action can be useful in development and test environments.
# Not recommended for production use.
#
# WARNING: this will delete any data in your database!
#
add_action :reset

# == Firewall Update

#
add_action :firewall_update

# == Firewall Update Request
# Sends a remote_recipe that requests a database updates it's firewall rules.

add_action :firewall_update_request

# == Move Data Directory
# Relocate the database data directory
#
# Moves the data directory from the default install path to the path specified
# in name attribute or data_dir attribute of the resource.  This is used for
# relocating the data directory to a block device that provides snapshot
# functionality.
#
# This action should also setup a symlink from the old path to the new
# location.
#
add_action :move_data_dir


# == Generate dump file
add_action :generate_dump_file

# == restore db from dump file
add_action :restore_from_dump_file

# == Pre-backup Check
# Verify the database is in a good state for taking a snapshot.
#
# This action is used to verify correct state and to preform any
# other steps necessary before the database is locked.

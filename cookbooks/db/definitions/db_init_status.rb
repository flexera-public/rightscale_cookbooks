# Used to set and check node[:db][:init_status].
# When our database is at a point where it can be used, this is used to set the database
# as 'initialized'.  Other recipes that require the database to be 'initialized' use this
# to confirm.  If a check is done and a state is not what is expected, this receipe will
# error out with raise.
#
# @param name [Symbol] set to :set, :reset, or :check.  :set will set node[:db][:init_status] (state)
#   to :initialized.  :reset will set state to :uninitialized, :check will check requiring
#   expected_state param.
# @param expected_state [Symbol] when name set to :check, this is what the state should be.  If it
#   is not this state, will raise an error with the message of error_message param.
# @param error_message [String] the error message that is used if :check results in an error.
#
# @raises [RuntimeError] :name param must be either :set, :reset, :check or will raise an error.

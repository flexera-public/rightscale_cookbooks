  "long_description": "= RightScale App Cookbook\n\n== DESCRIPTION:\n\nRightScale application server management cookbook\n\nThis is an abstract cookbook that defines the recipes and interface to application provider\ncookbooks.   It is not a standalone cookbook and must be used in conjunction with an\napplication provider cookbook (i.e. app_php, app_tomcat, app_passenger or a user created application provider)\n\nMore detailed info you can find in app::* recipes description.\n\n== REQUIREMENTS:\n\n* Requires a VM launched from a RightScale managed RightImage\n* Requires a corresponding app provider cookbook\n\n== COOKBOOKS DEPENDENCIES:\nPlease see <tt>metadata.rb</tt> file for the latest dependencies.\n\n* <tt>sys_firewall</tt>\n* <tt>rightscale</tt>\n* <tt>repo</tt>\n* <tt>app_php</tt>\n* <tt>app_passenger</tt>\n* <tt>app_tomcat</tt>\n\n== KNOWN LIMITATIONS:\n\nThere are no known limitations.\n\n== SETUP:\n\nIn order to use App resource, you must create corresponding providers in your app server cookbook.\nSee for example app_passenger, app_php or app_tomcat cookbooks.\n\nYou must define app attributes which will be used in initialized app[default] resource\nRequired attributes:\n  node[:app][:provider] = \"app_passenger\"\nRecommended:\n  node[:app][:destination]\n  node[:app][:port]\n  node[:app][:root]\n  node[:app][:database_name]\n  node[:app][:database_user]\n  node[:app][:database_password]\n  node[:app][:database_sever_fqdn]\nMore detailed description of these attribute variables is located in resource file description.\n\n== USAGE:\n\n1. Add the app_*::default recipe prior to the app::default recipe to define the provider.\n2. Add the default recipe to tag your server as an appserver. This is used by\n   servers (like databases) to identify their clients.\n3. Add desired app::do_* recipes to your application server ServerTemplate\n4. Develop corresponding providers in your application server cookbook.\n5. Define required and recommended attributes in your application server cookbook attributes file.\n\n== DETAILS:\n\n=== General\nThis cookbook is can only be used in conjunction with cookbooks that contain\nLightweight Providers which implement the 'app' interface. See the RightScale\napp_php cookbook for an example.\n\nNote: app[default] resource uses \"persist true\" flag, which allow to save created resource and its attributes in memory for future use.\n\nThis cookbook contains recipes, required to connect your instance to Rightscel Loadbalancer ServerTemplate\n* do_loadbalancers_allow\n* do_loadbalancers_deny\n* request_loadbalancer_allow\n* request_loadbalancer_deny\n\nfor more info please see: http://support.rightscale.com/03-Tutorials/02-AWS/02-Website_Edition/2.5_Load_Balancer_Setups\n\n=== Attributes:\n\n* <tt>node[:app][:provider]</tt> - Set a default provider.\n* <tt>node[:app][:port]</tt> - Set a default port to listen on. Default: 8000\n* <tt>node[:app][:ip]</tt> - Ip to listen on. Default: First private IP\n\n=== Templates:\nnone\n\n=== Definitions:\n\n<b>app_add_listen_port</b>\nAdds a port to the apache listen ports.conf file and node attribute\n\nCreate node[:apache][:listen_ports] - array of strings for the webserver to listen on.\n\nThis definition created specifically for the apache2 cookbook at this time.\n\n===== Example:\n\n app_add_listen_port php_port\n\n\n=== Libraries-helpers:\n\n===== RightScale::App::Helper.bind_ip(private_ips = [ ], public_ips = [ ])\n\nReturn the IP address of the interface that this application server listens on.\n\n<b>Parameters</b>\n\n* <tt>private_ips(Array)::</tt> List of private ips assigned to the application server\n* <tt>public_ips(Array)::</tt> List of public ips assigned to the application server\n\n<b>Returns</b>\n\n<tt>String::</tt> IP Address\n\n<b>Raise</b>\n\n<tt>RuntimeError::</tt> If niether a valid private nor public ip can be found\n\n\n===== RightScale::App::Helper.bind_port()\n\nReturn the port that this application server listens on\n\n<b>Returns</b>\n\n<tt>node[:app][:port](integer)</tt> Port number\n\n\n===== RightScale::App::Helper.vhosts(vhost_list)\n\ncreated to convert vhost names into array from a comma separated list\n\n<b>Parameters</b>\n\n<tt>vhost_list(Sting)::</tt> Comma separated list of virtual hosts\n\n<b>Returns</b>\n\n<tt>Array::</tt> Array of vhosts\n\n\n=== LWRPs:\n\nThis cookbook provides abstract <tt>app</tt> resource. Which will act as \"interface\" for corresponding LightWeight app_* providers\n\nThis includes app_php, app_tomcat and app_passenger cookbooks. Each of them contain implementation of corresponding app__* LightWeight Provider\nwhich can be called using this resource.\n\nProvider persisted in this cookbook will act as a cap if there will be no another app_ LightWeight Provider implementation. To aviod unexpected fails.\n\nFor more information about Lightweight Resources and Providers (LWRPs), please see:\nhttp://support.rightscale.com/12-Guides/Chef_Cookbooks_Developer_Guide/08-Chef_Development/Lightweight_Resources_and_Providers_(LWRP)\n\n\n===== App resource actions\nAll actions declared in this resource define the interface for typical application server operations.\n\n* <tt>:install</tt> - Install packages required for application server setup\n\n* <tt>:setup_vhost</tt> - Action designed to setup APP LWRP with common parameters required for apache vhost file\n\n* <tt>:start</tt> - Action designed to setup user defined start sequence for application server.\n\n* <tt>:stop</tt> - Action designed to setup user defined stop sequence for application server.\n\n* <tt>:restart</tt> - Action designed to setup user defined restart sequence for application server.\n\n* <tt>:code_update</tt> - Action designed to perform project source code update/download\n\n* <tt>:setup_db_connection</tt> -  Action designed to perform database configuration file creation\n\n* <tt>:setup_monitoring</tt> - Action designed to install and setup of required monitoring software.\n\n\n===== App resource attributes\n\n* <tt>packages</tt> - Set of installed packages\n* <tt>root</tt> - Application root\n* <tt>port</tt> - Application port\n* <tt>destination</tt> - Path to where project repo will be pulled\n* <tt>database_name</tt> - Name of the required database\n* <tt>database_user</tt> - Database user\n* <tt>database_password</tt> - Database password\n* <tt>database_sever_fqdn</tt> - Database server fqdn\n\n\n===== Usage Examples:\nOnly basic examples here. More detailed examples of this resource use you can find in cookbook recipes do_* and setup_*\n\n app \"default\" do\n   persist true\nend\n   provider node[:app][:provider]\n   packages node[:app][:packages]\n   action :install\n end\n\n app \"default\" do\n   database_name        node[:app][:database_name]\n   database_user        node[:app][:database_user]\n   database_password    node[:app][:database_password]\n   database_sever_fqdn  node[:app][:database_sever_fqdn]\n   action :setup_db_connection\n end\n\n app \"default\" do\n   root node[:app][:root]\n   port node[:app][:port].to_i\n   action :setup_vhost\n end\n\n\n= LICENSE:\n\nCopyright RightScale, Inc.

  "long_description": "= RightScale App Cookbook\n\n== DESCRIPTION:\n\nRightScale application server management cookbook\n\nThis is an abstract cookbook that defines the recipes and interface to\napplication provider cookbooks.  It is not a standalone cookbook and must be\nused in conjunction with an application provider cookbook (i.e.\n<tt>app_php</tt>, app_tomcat, app_passenger or a user created application\nprovider).\n\nMore detailed info you can find in app::* recipes description.\n\n== REQUIREMENTS:\n\n* Requires a VM launched from a RightScale managed RightImage\n* Requires a corresponding app provider cookbook\n\n== COOKBOOKS DEPENDENCIES:\nPlease see <tt>metadata.rb</tt> file for the latest dependencies.\n\n* <tt>sys_firewall</tt>\n* <tt>rightscale</tt>\n* <tt>repo</tt>\n* <tt>app_php</tt>\n* <tt>app_passenger</tt>\n* <tt>app_tomcat</tt>\n\n== KNOWN LIMITATIONS:\n\nThere are no known limitations.\n\n== SETUP:\n\nIn order to use App resource, you must create corresponding providers in your\napp server cookbook. See for example <tt>app_passenger</tt>, <tt>app_php</tt> or\n<tt>app_tomcat</tt> cookbooks.\n\nYou must define app attributes which will be used in initialized\n<tt>app[default]</tt> resource.\n\nRequired attributes:\n\n  node[:app][:provider] = \"app_passenger\"\n\nRecommended:\n\n  node[:app][:destination]\n  node[:app][:port]\n  node[:app][:root]\n  node[:app][:database_name]\n  node[:app][:database_user]\n  node[:app][:database_password]\n  node[:app][:database_sever_fqdn]\n\nMore detailed description of these attribute variables is located in resource\nfile description.\n\n== USAGE:\n\n1. Add the <tt>app_*::default</tt> recipe prior to the <tt>app::default</tt>\n   recipe to define the provider.\n2. Add the default recipe to tag your server as an appserver. This is used by\n   servers (like databases) to identify their clients.\n3. Add desired <tt>app::do_*</tt> recipes to your application server\n   ServerTemplate.\n4. Develop corresponding providers in your application server cookbook.\n5. Define required and recommended attributes in your application server\n   cookbook attributes file.\n\n== DETAILS:\n\n=== General\nThis cookbook is can only be used in conjunction with cookbooks that contain\nLightweight Providers which implement the 'app' interface. See the RightScale\napp_php cookbook for an example.\n\nNote: <tt>app[default]</tt> resource uses \"persist true\" flag, which allow to\nsave created resource and its attributes in memory for future use.\n\nThis cookbook contains recipes, required to connect your instance to RightScale\nLoad balancer ServerTemplate:\n\n* <tt>do_loadbalancers_allow</tt>\n* <tt>do_loadbalancers_deny</tt>\n* <tt>request_loadbalancer_allow</tt>\n* <tt>request_loadbalancer_deny</tt>\n\nFor more info please see: {Load Balancer Setups}[http://support.rightscale.com/03-Tutorials/02-AWS/02-Website_Edition/2.5_Load_Balancer_Setups].\n\n=== Attributes:\n\n* <tt>node[:app][:provider]</tt> - Set a default provider.\n* <tt>node[:app][:port]</tt> - Set a default port to listen on. Default: 8000\n* <tt>node[:app][:ip]</tt> - Ip to listen on. Default: First private IP\n\n=== Definitions:\n\n<b>app_add_listen_port</b>\nAdds a port to the apache listen ports.conf file and node attribute\n\nCreate node[:apache][:listen_ports] - array of strings for the web server to listen on.\n\nThis definition created specifically for the apache2 cookbook at this time.\n\n===== Example:\n\n app_add_listen_port php_port\n\n\n=== Libraries-helpers:\n\n===== RightScale::App::Helper.bind_ip(private_ips = [ ], public_ips = [ ])\n\nReturn the IP address of the interface that this application server listens on.\n\n<b>Parameters</b>\n\n* <tt>private_ips(Array)::</tt> List of private ips assigned to the application server\n* <tt>public_ips(Array)::</tt> List of public ips assigned to the application server\n\n<b>Returns</b>\n\n<tt>String::</tt> IP Address\n\n<b>Raise</b>\n\n<tt>RuntimeError::</tt> If neither a valid private nor public ip can be found\n\n\n===== RightScale::App::Helper.bind_port()\n\nReturn the port that this application server listens on\n\n<b>Returns</b>\n\n<tt>node[:app][:port](integer)</tt> Port number\n\n\n===== RightScale::App::Helper.vhosts(vhost_list)\n\ncreated to convert vhost names into array from a comma separated list\n\n<b>Parameters</b>\n\n<tt>vhost_list(Sting)::</tt> Comma separated list of virtual hosts\n\n<b>Returns</b>\n\n<tt>Array::</tt> Array of vhosts\n\n\n=== LWRPs:\n\nThis cookbook provides abstract <tt>app</tt> resource. Which will act as\n\"interface\" for corresponding Light Weight app_* providers.\n\nThis includes <tt>app_php</tt>, <tt>app_tomcat</tt> and <tt>app_passenger</tt>\ncookbooks. Each of them contains an implementation of the corresponding app__*\nLight Weight Provider which can be called using this resource.\n\nProvider persisted in this cookbook will act as a cap if there will be no\nanother app_ Light Weight Provider implementation. To avoid unexpected fails.\n\nFor more information about Lightweight Resources and Providers (LWRPs), please\nsee: {Light Weight Resources and Providers (LWRP)}[http://support.rightscale.com/12-Guides/Chef_Cookbooks_Developer_Guide/08-Chef_Development/Lightweight_Resources_and_Providers_(LWRP)].\n\n\n===== App resource actions\n\nAll actions declared in this resource define the interface for typical\napplication server operations.\n\n* <tt>:install</tt> - Install packages required for application server setup\n\n* <tt>:setup_vhost</tt> - Action designed to setup APP LWRP with common\n  parameters required for apache vhost file\n\n* <tt>:start</tt> - Action designed to setup user defined start sequence for\n  application server.\n\n* <tt>:stop</tt> - Action designed to setup user defined stop sequence for\n  application server.\n\n* <tt>:restart</tt> - Action designed to setup user defined restart sequence for\n  application server.\n\n* <tt>:code_update</tt> - Action designed to perform project source code\n  update/download\n\n* <tt>:setup_db_connection</tt> - Action designed to perform database\n  configuration file creation\n\n* <tt>:setup_monitoring</tt> - Action designed to install and setup of required\n  monitoring software.\n\n\n===== App resource attributes\n\n* <tt>packages</tt> - Set of installed packages\n* <tt>root</tt> - Application root\n* <tt>port</tt> - Application port\n* <tt>destination</tt> - Path to where project repo will be pulled\n* <tt>database_name</tt> - Name of the required database\n* <tt>database_user</tt> - Database user\n* <tt>database_password</tt> - Database password\n* <tt>database_sever_fqdn</tt> - Database server fqdn\n\n\n===== Usage Examples:\nOnly basic examples here. More detailed examples of this resource use can be\nfound in the do_* and setup_* recipes in the cookbook.\n\n app \"default\" do\n   persist true\nend\n   provider node[:app][:provider]\n   packages node[:app][:packages]\n   action :install\n end\n\n app \"default\" do\n   database_name node[:app][:database_name]\n   database_user node[:app][:database_user]\n   database_password node[:app][:database_password]\n   database_sever_fqdn node[:app][:database_sever_fqdn]\n   action :setup_db_connection\n end\n\n app \"default\" do\n   root node[:app][:root]\n   port node[:app][:port].to_i\n   action :setup_vhost\n end\n\n\n= LICENSE:\n\nCopyright RightScale, Inc.

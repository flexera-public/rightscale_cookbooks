recipe "app::default", "Adds the appserver:active=true, appserver:listen_ip=<ip> and appserver:listen_port=<port> tags to your server which identifies it as an application server and tells the load balancer what IP address and port to connect to. For example, a 'master' database server will update its firewall port permissions to accept incoming requests from application servers with this tag."

recipe "app::do_loadbalancers_allow", "Allows connections from all load balancers within a given listener pool which are tagged with loadbalancer:lb=<applistener_name>.  This script should be run on an application server before it makes a request to be connected to the load balancers."

recipe "app::do_loadbalancers_deny", "Denies connections from all load balancers which are tagged with loadbalancer:lb=<applistener_name>.  For example, you can run this script on an application server to deny connections from all load balancers within a given listener pool."

recipe "app::request_loadbalancer_allow", "Sends a request to all application servers tagged with loadbalancer:app=<applistener_name> to allow connections from the server's private IP address. This script should be run on a load balancer before any application servers are attached to it."

recipe "app::request_loadbalancer_deny", "Sends a request to all application servers tagged with loadbalancer:app=<applistener_name> to deny connections from the server's private IP address. This script should be run on a load balancer after disconnecting application servers or upon decommissioning."

recipe "app::setup_vhost", "Set up the application vhost on port 8000. This recipe will call the corresponding provider from the app server cookbook, which creates an apache vhost file."

recipe "app::setup_db_connection", "Set up the database connection file. This recipe will call the corresponding provider from app server cookbook, which creates an application database configuration file."

recipe "app::do_update_code", "Updates application source files from the remote repository. This recipe will call the corresponding provider from the app server cookbook, which will download/update application source code."

recipe "app::setup_monitoring", "Install collectd monitoring. This recipe will call the corresponding provider from the app server cookbook, which installs and configures required monitoring software."

recipe "app::do_server_start", "Runs application server start sequence."

recipe "app::do_server_restart", "Runs application server restart sequence."

recipe "app::do_server_stop", "Runs application server stop sequence."

recipe "app::do_server_reload", "Runs application server reload sequence."

recipe "app::handle_loadbalancers_allow", "Remote recipe run on app server from loadbalancer requesting access. DO NOT RUN."

recipe "app::handle_loadbalancers_deny", "Remote recipe run on app server from loadbalancer revoking access. DO NOT RUN."

See the <tt>db/README.rdoc</tt> for usage\ndetails.\n\n\n=== PostgreSQL Tuning and postgresql.conf and pg_hba.conf\n\nCustom tuning parameters can be applied by overriding the <tt>postgres_tuning.rb</tt>\nattributes file. For more information and an example override repository,\nplease see: {Override Chef Cookbooks}[http://support.rightscale.com/12-Guides/Chef_Cookbooks_Developer_Guide/08-Chef_Development/Override_Chef_Cookbooks].\n\n== DETAILS:\n\nThe 'db' implementation is defined by a Lightweight Provider, which can be\nfound in the <tt>providers/default.rb</tt> file.\n\n= LICENSE:\n\nCopyright RightScale, Inc.

If the primary server crashes then some transactions that were committed may not have been replicated to the standby server, causing data loss. The amount of data loss is proportional to the replication delay at the time of failover.\nSynchronous replication offers the ability to confirm that all changes made by a transaction have been transferred to one synchronous standby server. This extends the standard level of durability offered by a transaction commit. This level of protection is referred to as 2-safe replication in computer science theory.\nRef: http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/warm-standby.html#SYNCHRONOUS-REPLICATION",

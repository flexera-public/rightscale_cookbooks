= RightScale Load Balancer Cookbook 

== DESCRIPTION:

This cookbook provides a set of load balancer recipes used by the RightScale
Load Balancer ServerTemplates.

This cookbook does not contain a specific load balancer implementation; rather,
it provides an interface for general load balancer actions and parameters.

== DETAILS:

=== General
The 'lb' interface is defined by a Lightweight Resource, which can be found in
the resources/default.rb file.

This cookbook is intended to be used in conjunction with cookbooks that contain
Lightweight Providers that implement the 'lb' interface. See the RightScale
lb_haproxy cookbook for an example.

To review information about Lightweight Resources and Providers (LWRPs), see the Chef
Wiki at:

== REQUIREMENTS:

 * Requires a virtual machine launched from a RightScale-managed RightImage.

== SETUP:

== USAGE:

=== Application Server Attach

==== do_attach_request

This recipe is used by application servers to request that load balancer servers
configure themselves to attach to the application server.

==== handle_attach recipes

This recipe is used by a load balancer server to add an application server to
its configuration when the application server requests it, and restart if necessary.

=== Application Server Detach

==== do_detach_request

This recipe is used by application servers to request that load balancer servers
configure themselves to detach from the application server.

==== handle_detach recipes

This recipe is used by a load balancer server to remove an application server
from its configuration when the application server requests it, and restart if necessary.

=== Automatic Server Detection

==== do_attach_all recipe

This recipe is used by the load balancer to automatically detect whether application
servers have disappeared or reappeared, without detaching or reattaching using the
other recipes. This recipe is set to run in a periodic reconverge, which, by default, runs every 15 minutes.

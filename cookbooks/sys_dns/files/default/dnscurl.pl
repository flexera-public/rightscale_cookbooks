Welcome to AWS DNS curl! You'll need to install your AWS credentials to get started.

For security reasons, this tool will not accept your AWS secret access key on the
command line. Instead, you need to store them in a file named $secretsFile.
This file must be owned by you, and must be readable by only you.

For example:

\$ cat $secretsFile
\%awsSecretAccessKeys = (
    # my personal account

        id => '1ME55KNV6SBTR7EXG0R2',

    },

    # my corporate account
    'fred-work' => {
        id => '1ATXQ3HHA59CYF1CVS02',
        key => 'WQY4SrSS95pJUT95V6zWea01gBKBCL6PI0cdxeH8',

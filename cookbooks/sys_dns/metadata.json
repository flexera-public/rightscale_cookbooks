  "long_description": "# RightScale System DNS cookbook\n\n## DESCRIPTION:\n\nThis cookbook is available at [https://github.com/rightscale/rightscale_cookbooks](https://github.com/rightscale/rightscale_cookbooks).\n\nThis cookbook provides a set of dynamic DNS recipes used by RightScale\nServerTemplates including the Database Manager ServerTemplates.\n\n## REQUIREMENTS:\n\n* An account with the desired DNS service provider.\n* DNS A record’s created external to this cookbook.\n\n## COOKBOOKS DEPENDENCIES:\n\nPlease see `metadata.rb` file for the latest dependencies.\n\n## KNOWN LIMITATIONS:\n\nCurrently only the first private IP address can be set.\n\n## SETUP/USAGE:\n\n* Place `sys_dns::default` recipe into your runlist to set up the dynamic DNS\n  provider resource. This will install the support tools and chef providers for\n  the dynamic DNS provider selected by the \"DNS Service Provider\" input. When\n  using a RightScale ServerTemplate, this will automatically add the common DNS\n  service provider attributes to your ServerTemplate inputs.\n* Place `sys_dns::do_set_private` recipe in your runlist to set the DNS record\n  identified by the \"DNS Record ID\" input to the first private IP address of\n  the instance if the private IP is desired.\n* Place `sys_dns::do_set_public` recipe in your runlist to set the DNS record\n  identified by the \"DNS Record ID\" input to the first public IP address of the\n  instance if the public IP is desired. This recipe will fail if no valid\n  public IP is found for the instance.\n\n## DETAILS:\n\n### General\n\nCookbook currently supports Cloud DNS, DNSMadeEasy, DynDNS, and Amazon Route53\nDNS service providers.\nA new chef provider can be created to add support for additional dynamic DNS\nservice providers.\n\nFor additional information: [Deployment Prerequisites][link]\n[link]:http://support.rightscale.com/ServerTemplates/Infinity/Supplemental/Deployment_Prerequisites_(Linux)\n\n### Attributes:\n\nThese are settings used in recipes and templates. Default values are noted.\n\n* `node[:sys_dns][:choice]` -\n  The name of your DNS provider.\n* `node[:sys_dns][:id]` -\n  The unique identifier that is associated with the DNS A record of the server.\n* `node[:sys_dns][:user]` -\n  The username that is used to access and modify your DNS A records.\n* `node[:sys_dns][:password]` -\n  The password that is used to access and modify your DNS A records.\n* `node[:sys_dns][:region]` -\n  Region where the A records should be modified. This input only applies to\n  Cloud DNS.\n\n### Libraries-helpers:\n\nUse this section only if your cookbook contains any libraries.\nGive complete description of library purpose and functionality.\nProvide examples of how it is used in recipes.\n\n#### Example:\n\n    RightScale::DnsTools::CloudDNS.new(Chef::Log).action_set(id, user, password, address, region)\n    RightScale::DnsTools::DME.new(Chef::Log).action_set(id, user, password, address)\n    RightScale::DnsTools::DynDNS.new(Chef::Log).action_set(id, user, password, address)\n    RightScale::DnsTools::AWS.new(Chef::Log).action_set(id, user, password, address)\n\nReturn the result of A record update process.\n\nParameters:\n\n* `id::`\n  The unique identifier that is associated with the DNS A record of the server.\n* `user::`\n  The username that is used to access and modify the DNS A records.\n* `password::`\n  The password that is used to access and modify the DNS A records.\n* `address::`\n  Private IP address of the instance running the recipe.\n* `region::`\n  Region where the A records should be modified. This input only applies to\n  Cloud DNS.\n\nReturns:\n\n`Chef::Log::` A record successful update message.\n\nRaise:\n\n`Chef::Log::` Error message that may have occurred during the update process.\n\n### LWRPs:\n\nThe 'set' interface is defined by a Lightweight Resource, which can be found in\nthe resources/default.rb file.\n\nUsed to pass data to the helper file and call the corresponding DNS provider.\n\nFor more information, please see [Lightweight Resources and Providers][Guide].\n[Guide]: http://support.rightscale.com/12-Guides/Chef_Cookbooks_Developer_Guide/04-Developer/06-Development_Resources/Lightweight_Resources_and_Providers_(LWRP)\n\n#### Example:\n\nCommon attributes\n\n* `:id` -\n  The unique identifier that is associated with the DNS A record of the server.\n* `:user` -\n  The username that is used to access and modify your DNS A records.\n* `:password` -\n  The password that is used to access and modify your DNS A records.\n* `:address` -\n  Private IP address of the instance running the recipe.\n* `:region` -\n  Region where the A records should be modified. This input only applies to\n  Cloud DNS.\n* `:choice` -\n  One of the supported DNS providers:\"DNSMadeEasy\"/\"DynDNS\"/\"Route53\"/\"CloudDNS\"\n\n#### Example:\n\n**Update Action**\n\nTo update A record with a server's private IP address:\n\n    sys_dns \"default\" do\n      id node[:db][:dns][:slave][:id]\n      address private_ip\n      action :set\n    end\n\n## LICENSE:\n\nCopyright RightScale, Inc.

  "long_description": "= RightScale System Cookbook \n\n== DESCRIPTION:\n\nThis cookbook provides recipes for setting up a server for RightScale. This\nincludes setting up the running of periodic recipes and setting up swap.\n\n== REQUIREMENTS:\n\n* Requires a VM launched from a RightScale managed RightImage.\n\n== COOKBOOKS DEPENDENCIES:\n\nPlease see <tt>metadata.rb</tt> file for the latest dependencies.\n\n== KNOWN LIMITATIONS:\n\nThere are no known limitations.\n\n== SETUP/USAGE:\n\n* Place the <tt>sys::default</tt> recipe into the boot recipes to have your\n  server set up with any periodic recipes from the inputs.\n* Place the <tt>sys::setup_swap</tt> recipe into the boot recipes to set up\n  swap on your server. You may wish to use ephemeral storage for swap, in that\n  case you should include the <tt>block_device::setup_ephemeral</tt> recipe\n  before it.\n* You can disable and enable the periodic recipes running by running the\n  <tt>sys::do_reconverge_list_disable</tt> and\n  <tt>sys::do_reconverge_list_enable</tt> recipes.\n\n== DETAILS:\n\n=== Sysem Consistency (re-convergence)\n\n  To enforce a consistent system state, one can use this LWRP to schedule\n  a cron job to periodically run a recipe.  Currently the period is hard-coded\n  to every 15 minutes -- with a random starting offset (to distribute runs\n  being performed by multiple systems).\n\n  To start a periodic reconverge:\n\n      sys_reconverge \"mycookbook::myrecipe\"\n\n  To stop a periodic reconverge:\n\n      sys_reconverge \"mycookbook::myrecipe\" do\n        action :disable\n      end\n\n= LICENSE:\n\nCopyright RightScale, Inc.

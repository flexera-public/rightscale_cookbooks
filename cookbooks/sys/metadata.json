Currently the period is hard-coded\n  to every 15 minutes -- with a random starting offset (to distribute runs\n  being performed by multiple systems).\n\n  To start a periodic reconverge:\n\n      sys_reconverge \"mycookbook::myrecipe\"\n\n  To stop a periodic reconverge:\n\n      sys_reconverge \"mycookbook::myrecipe\" do\n        action :disable\n      end\n\n== KNOWN LIMITATIONS:\n\n= LICENSE\n\nCopyright RightScale, Inc.

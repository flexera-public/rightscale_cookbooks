= RightScale System Cookbook 

== DESCRIPTION:

This cookbook provides recipes for setting up a server for RightScale. This
includes setting up the running of periodic recipes and setting up swap.

== REQUIREMENTS:

* Requires a VM launched from a RightScale managed RightImage.

== COOKBOOKS DEPENDENCIES:

Please see <tt>metadata.rb</tt> file for the latest dependencies.

== KNOWN LIMITATIONS:

There are no known limitations.

== SETUP/USAGE:

* Place the <tt>sys::default</tt> recipe into the boot recipes to have your
  server set up with any periodic recipes from the inputs.
* Place the <tt>sys::setup_swap</tt> recipe into the boot recipes to set up
  swap on your server. You may wish to use ephemeral storage for swap, in that
  case you should include the <tt>block_device::setup_ephemeral</tt> recipe
  before it.
* You can disable and enable the periodic recipes running by running the
  <tt>sys::do_reconverge_list_disable</tt> and
  <tt>sys::do_reconverge_list_enable</tt> recipes.

== DETAILS:

=== Sysem Consistency (re-convergence)

  To enforce a consistent system state, one can use this LWRP to schedule
  a cron job to periodically run a recipe.  Currently the period is hard-coded
  to every 15 minutes -- with a random starting offset (to distribute runs
  being performed by multiple systems).

  To start a periodic reconverge:

      sys_reconverge "mycookbook::myrecipe"

  To stop a periodic reconverge:

      sys_reconverge "mycookbook::myrecipe" do
        action :disable
      end

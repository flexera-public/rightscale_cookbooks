The validation_name\n  located on the Server and in the Client configuration file must match.\n* `node[:chef][:client][:node_name]`-\n  The node's name to register on the Chef Server.\n* `node[:chef][:client][:roles]`-\n  Comma separated list of roles which will be applied to this instance. Roles\n  should be defined on the Chef Server else recipe will fail.\n* `node[:chef][:client][:environment]`-\n  The Chef Server environment name. By default the Chef Client environment\n  variable is set to \"_default\".\n* `node[:chef][:client][:company]`-\n  Company name to be set in the Client configuration file. This attribute is\n  applicable for Opscode Hosted Chef Server. The company name specified in both\n  the Server and the Client configuration file must match.\n* `chef/client/json_attributes`-\n  A custom JSON string to be added to the first run of chef-client.\n\n### Templates:\n\n* `chef_client_conf.erb`-\n  The Chef Client configuration file. Used in `chef::install_client` recipe.\n* `validation_key.erb`-\n  Private SSH key which will be used to authenticate the Chef Client on the\n  remote Chef Server. Used in `chef::install_client` and\n  `chef::do_client_converge` recipes.\n* `runlist.json.erb`-\n  The Chef Client runlist.json file. Defined in setup_runlist definition and\n  used in `chef::install_client` and `chef::do_client_converge` recipes.\n\n### Usage Example:\n\n## Update and execute runlist.\n\n* `chef::do_client_converge`\n  This recipe is used in the operational phase only. It runs runlist from file.\n  To update the roles user can provide new roles as input and run the recipe.\n  Roles to be used should be available on the Chef Server.\n\n## Chef Client Reconvergence\n\n* `sys::do_reconverge_list_enable`\n  This recipe is used in the boot and operational phase. It starts a periodic\n  reconverge.\n\n* `sys::do_reconverge_list_disable`\n  This recipe is used in the operational phase.

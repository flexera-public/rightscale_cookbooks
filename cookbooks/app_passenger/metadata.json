  "long_description": "= RightScale App Passenger Cookbook\n\n== DESCRIPTION:\n\n* Cookbook provides apache+passenger implementation of the app LWRP.\n* Installs and configures, apache+passenger application server.\n\n== REQUIREMENTS:\n\n* Requires a VM launched from a RightScale managed RightImage\n* Tested on CentOS 5.6 RightImage\n* Tested on Ubuntu 10.04 RightImage\n\n== SETUP:\n\n* Place app_passenger::default recipe into your runlist to setup the application \n  server. Since this sets up the app provider, it must be run before the \n  app::default recipe (which expects a provider to already be set)\n* When using a RightScale ServerTemplate, this will also automatically add the\n  common attributes to your ServerTemplate inputs.\n\n== USAGE:\n\n* Template can be combined in two modes:\n\n  1 For apps with bundler support\n    You have to add \"install_required app gems\" recipe, and \"run_custom_rails_commands\" for migration commands\n  2 For apps without bundler support\n    You have to add \"install_custom_gems\"  recipe, and \"run_custom_rails_commands\" for migration commands\n  Anyway you can mix these recipes to fit needs of your project.\n\n== KNOWN LIMITATIONS\n\n* none\n\n== DETAILS\n\nRubyEE packages coming from official RubyEE project page\nhttp://code.google.com/p/rubyenterpriseedition/downloads/detail?name=ruby-enterprise-1.8.7-2011.03.tar.gz&can=2&q=\nconfigured and packed for Ubuntu CentOS and RHEL.\n\n= LICENSE\n\nCopyright RightScale, Inc.

== DETAILS:

=== General

The 'repo_rsync' implementation can be called with the help of the Lightweight Resource, which can be
found in the <tt>repo</tt> cookbook.

For more information about Lightweight Resources and Providers (LWRPs), please see {Lightweight Resources and Providers}[http://support.rightscale.com/12-Guides/Chef_Cookbooks_Developer_Guide/08-Chef_Development/Lightweight_Resources_and_Providers_(LWRP)].

-------------

=== LWRPs:

The <tt>repo_rsync</tt> provider is defined in the <tt>providers/default.rb</tt> file, which contains source code for <tt>:pull</tt> and <tt>:capistrano_pull</tt> actions.
For more info about these actions please see the <tt>repo</tt> cookbook's README.

The <tt>repo_rsync</tt> provider allows the retrieval of source code via rsync.

For normal operations, it requires the 'repo' resource, which acts as the interface to all <tt>repo_rsync</tt> provider logic.

===== Actions:
<tt>:pull</tt>
Standard repository pull. Pull source code from a remote repository by specifying its location with a URL.

<tt>:capistrano_pull</tt>
Perform standard pull and then a capistrano deployment style will be applied.

===== Usage Example:

For usage examples, please see the corresponding section in <tt>repo</tt> cookbook's README.

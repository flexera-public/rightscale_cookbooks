  "long_description": "= RightScale Rackspace Cloud Load Balancers (CLB) Cookbook\n\n== DESCRIPTION:\n\nRightScale load balancer cookbook for Rackspace Cloud Load Balancing (CLB).\n\nThis cookbook provides recipes for attaching and detaching application servers\nto and from an existing Rackspace Cloud Load Balancer (CLB).\n\n== DETAILS:\n\nThe recipes in this cookbook are designed to enable an application server to attach itself to or detach itself from an existing Rackspace Cloud Load Balancer (CLB).\nThe name of the existing CLB is provided as an input. The application server is\nthen associated with the CLB on Rackspace. Administrators create and edit CLBs using the Rackspace web interface.\n\n== REQUIREMENTS:\n\n* Requires a virtual machine launched from a RightScale-managed RightImage\n\n* Requires an existing Rackspace Cloud Load Balancer\n\n== SETUP:\n\n== USAGE:\n\n=== Application Server Attach\n\n==== do_attach_request\n\nThis recipe is used by application servers to request that a Rackspace CLB \nattach the application server to its configuration. The recipe sends\nthe server's internal IP address as a parameter to the CLB.\n\n=== Application Server Detach\n\n==== do_detach_request\n\nThis recipe is used by application servers to request that a Rackspace CLB \ndetach the application server from its configuration. The recipe sends\nthe server's internal IP address as a parameter to the CLB. Note: If this is the only\napplication server in the CLB configuration, it will not detach. This is a known limitation of Rackspace CLB, and is disallowed in the Rackspace web interface as well.\n\n== KNOWN LIMITATIONS:\n\n* If an application server is the only attached item for a CLB, it cannot be detached.\n  This appears to be by design, as attempting to do this manually from the Rackspace web interface\n  also fails.\n\n= LICENSE\n\nCopyright RightScale, Inc.

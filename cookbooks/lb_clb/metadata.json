The application server is\nthen associated with the CLB on RackSpace. Administrators create and edit CLBs using the Rackspace web interface.\n\n== REQUIREMENTS:\n\n* Requires a virtual machine launched from a RightScale-managed RightImage\n\n* Requires an existing RackSpace Cloud Load Balancer\n\n== SETUP:\n\n== USAGE:\n\n=== Application Server Attach\n\n==== do_attach_request\n\nThis recipe is used by application servers to request that a Rackspace CLB \nattach the application server to its configuration. The recipe sends\nthe server's internal IP address as a parameter to the CLB.\n\n=== Application Server Detach\n\n==== do_detach_request\n\nThis recipe is used by application servers to request that a RackSpace CLB \ndetach the application server from its configuration. The recipe sends\nthe server's internal IP address as a parameter to the CLB. Note: If this is the only\napplication server in the CLB configuration, it will not detach. This is a known limitation of Rackspace CLB, and is disallowed in the Rackspace web interface as well.\n\n== KNOWN LIMITATIONS:\n\n* If an application server is the only attached item for a CLB, it cannot be detached.\n  This appears to be by design, as attempting to do this manually from the Rackspace web interface\n  also fails.\n\n= LICENSE\n\nCopyright RightScale, Inc.

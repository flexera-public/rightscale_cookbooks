  "long_description": "= Storage Toolbox Cookbook\n\n== DESCRIPTION:\n\nThis cookbook provides the building blocks for Multi-Cloud backup/restore\nsupport. This leverages the RightScale platform's 1.0 and 1.5 API for performing\nvolume management across multiple clouds.\n\n== REQUIREMENTS:\n\n* The block device tools depend on the <tt>rightscale::install_tools</tt>\n  recipe.\n* Requires a virtual machine launched from a RightScale-managed RightImage.\n\n== COOKBOOKS DEPENDENCIES:\n\nPlease see <tt>metadata.rb</tt> file for the latest dependencies.\n\n== KNOWN LIMITATIONS:\n\n* Rackspace requires an instance size of 512MB or larger. An instance size of\n  256MG is not supported. (w-3947)\n* Multiple block devices are not supported on Rackspace.\n\n== SETUP/USAGE:\n\n=== Getting started and taking the first backup:\n\n1. Import the latest version of 'Storage Toolbox (Chef)' ServerTemplate into\n   your RightScale account.\n2. Set up a deployment and Launch.\n3. Once the Server is operational consider it in a 'pristine state'. Nothing\n   will happen other than installing the tools until you run an operational\n   recipe. You can modify this behavior by cloning the ServerTemplate and\n   changing the list of recipes to run on boot.\n4. Run the recipe \"block_device::setup_block_device\".  This recipe attaches\n   storage based on the volume size and number of volumes you have specified.\n   The storage is located in '/mnt/storage1' by default.\n5. Add your data into /mnt/storage1.\n6. Run the recipe \"block_device::do_primary_backup\". This recipe detects\n   what cloud you are on and performs a backup to local cloud persistence\n   service.\n\n=== Continuous Backups with CRON:\n\n1. Enable continuous backups by running the recipe\n   \"block_device::setup_continuous_backups\".  This sets up a cron job.\n2. You can disable backups at any time by running\n   \"block_device::do_disable_continuous_backups\". This removes the cron job\n   that was performing backups.\n\n=== Force Reset:\n\n1. WARNING: this detaches all storage related to your lineage and DESTROYs the\n   volumes\\! This is to be used if you'd like to force run a restore but you\n   already have storage attached that you don't want. After running the recipe\n   \"block_device::do_force_reset\" you can then run\n   \"block_device::setup_block_device\" or \"block_device::do_restore\".\n\n=== Restore:\n\n1. Start from a pristine state (fresh launch of a new server or using a server\n   that's been reset).\n2. Run the recipe \"block_device::do_restore\".\n\nMix and match recipes to get the right combination for your deployments.\n\n== DETAILS:\n\nMultiple block device support is controlled by the\n<tt>block_device/devices_to_use</tt> input. It can be a comma-separated list of\ndevice names or '*' to indicate all devices. By default there are two available\nblock devices. Currently, in order to add more devices you need to override the\ncookbook. Instructions can be found at:\nhttp://support.rightscale.com/12-Guides/Chef_Cookbooks_Developer_Guide/08-Chef_Development/Increase_the_Number_of_Block_Devices\n\n= LICENSE:\n\nCopyright RightScale, Inc.

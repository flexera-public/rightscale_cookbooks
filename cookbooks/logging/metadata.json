When using a RightScale ServerTemplate, this will also automatically\n  configure logging service provider (rsyslog/syslog-ng). If a remote server is\n  specified the default  recipe will determine the logging provider installed\n  (rsyslog/syslog-ng) and configure it for remote logging.\n* To setup a logging server, place the following recipes in order to your\n  runlist:\n\n    logging_<provider>::setup_server\n      sets up the logging provider.\n\n    logging::install_server\n      sets up generic server inputs and configures a logging server.\n\n  For example: To set up and install an rsyslog logging server\n\n    logging_rsyslog::setup_server\n    logging::install_server\n\n## USAGE:\n\n1. Local Logging - Set the 'logging/remote_server' input to 'ignore' to use\n   the default configuration installed.\n2. Remote Logging - Set the 'logging/remote_server' input to the FQDN or IP of\n   the designated remote logging server to adjust the default configuration to\n   the remote logging configuration.\n3. Transfer protocol - Set the 'logging/protocol' input to one of the listed\n   options:\n   1. UDP: the most generic and common-used option. UDP is the default logging\n      protocol option.\n   2. RELP: RELP stands for Reliable Event Logging Protocol.\n      RELP ensures that no message is lost, not even when connections break and\n      a peer becomes unavailable.\n   3. RELP-secured: while using RELP to ensure a safe and loss-free transmission\n      between two machines the traffic also gets encrypted with an SSL\n      certificate the user should provide with the 'logging/certificate' input.\n      As stunnel is configured with the \"verify = 3\" option the server would\n      require and verify the client certificate against the locally installed\n      certificate providing client authentication.\n\n## DETAILS:\n\n### General\n\nThe 'logging' interface is defined by a Lightweight Resource, which can be found\nin the `resources/default.rb` file.\n\nThis cookbook is intended as a framework for logging providers. The current\nimplementation supports the minimum configuration for rsyslog and syslog-ng.\n\nNote: This cookbook does not modify the installed logging provider.\n\nFor more information about Lightweight Resources and Providers (LWRPs), please\nsee: [Lightweight Resources and Providers][LWRP]\n\n[LWRP]: http://support.rightscale.com/12-Guides/Chef_Cookbooks_Developer_Guide/08-Chef_Development/Lightweight_Resources_and_Providers_(LWRP)\n\n### Providers:\n\nThe current implementation does not support providers other than rsyslog and\nsyslog-ng.\n\n### Custom Configuration:\n\nBy using an override cookbook the default configuration can be customized by\nreplacing the default configuration file template for the provider. For more\ninformation, please see: [Override Chef Cookbooks][CCDG].\n\n[CCDG]: http://support.rightscale.com/12-Guides/Chef_Cookbooks_Developer_Guide/08-Chef_Development/Override_Chef_Cookbooks\n\n## LICENSE:\n\nCopyright RightScale, Inc.

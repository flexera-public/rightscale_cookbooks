If not the the default configuration is used (local files)\n\n== REQUIREMENTS:\n\n* Must be used with a 'logging' provider in the cookbook path\n* Requires a virtual machine launched from a RightScale-managed RightImage.\n\n== COOKBOOOKS DEPENDENCIES:\n\nPlease see <tt>metadata.rb</tt> file for the latest dependencies.\n\n== KNOWN LIMITATIONS:\n\n* Currently only supports the logging provider installed on the image. (rsyslog/syslog-ng)\n* Currently only supports client configuration for a single remote server using\n  UDP without encryption or authentication.\n* Requires customer maintained remote server for remote logging.\n\n== SETUP:\n\n* Place logging::default recipe into your runlist to setup the logging resource. When\n  using a RightScale ServerTemplate, this will also automatically configure\n  logging service provider (rsyslog/syslog-ng)\n\n* The default recipe will determine the logging provider installed (rsyslog/syslog-ng)\n  and configure it for remote logging.\n\n== USAGE:\n\n* For local logging only.  Set the input logging/remote_server to ignore.  The default\n  configuration installed will be used.\n\n* For remote logging.  Set the input logging/remote_server to the FQDN or IP of your\n  logging server.  The default configuration will be used with the remote logging\n  configuration appeneded.\n\n== DETAILS:\n\n=== General\n\nThe 'logging' interface is defined by a Lightweight Resource, which can be found in\nthe <tt>resources/default.rb</tt> file.\n\nThis cookbook is intended as a framework for logging providers.  In its current\nimplementation it supports the minimum configuration for rsyslog and syslog-ng.\n\nThis cookbook does not modify the installed logging provider.\n\n=== Providers:\n\nThe current implementation does not support providers other than rsyslog and syslog-ng.\n\n=== Custom Configuration:\n\nBy using an override cookbook the default configuration can be customized by replacing\nthe default configuration file template for the provider.\n\n= LICENSE:\n\nCopyright RightScale, Inc.

= RightScale Logging

== DESCRIPTION:

This cookbook provides a set of recipes used by the RightScale
ServerTemplates to configure the logging service provider.

This cookbook configures the default logging provider installed on the image.
If a remote server is defined it will configure sending log messages to the
remote server.  If not the the default configuration is used (local files)

== REQUIREMENTS:

* Must be used with a 'logging' provider in the cookbook path
* Requires a virtual machine launched from a RightScale-managed RightImage.

== COOKBOOKS DEPENDENCIES:

Please see <tt>metadata.rb</tt> file for the latest dependencies.

== KNOWN LIMITATIONS:

* Currently only supports the logging provider installed on the image. (rsyslog/syslog-ng)
* Currently only supports client configuration for a single remote server using
  UDP without encryption or authentication.
* Requires customer maintained remote server for remote logging.

== SETUP:

* Place logging::default recipe into your runlist to setup the logging resource. When
  using a RightScale ServerTemplate, this will also automatically configure
  logging service provider (rsyslog/syslog-ng)

* The default recipe will determine the logging provider installed (rsyslog/syslog-ng)
  and configure it for remote logging.

== USAGE:

* For local logging only.  Set the input logging/remote_server to ignore.  The default
  configuration installed will be used.

* For remote logging.  Set the input logging/remote_server to the FQDN or IP of your
  logging server.  The default configuration will be used with the remote logging
  configuration appended.

== DETAILS:

=== General

The 'logging' interface is defined by a Lightweight Resource, which can be found in
the <tt>resources/default.rb</tt> file.

This cookbook is intended as a framework for logging providers.  In its current
implementation it supports the minimum configuration for rsyslog and syslog-ng.

This cookbook does not modify the installed logging provider.

=== Providers:

The current implementation does not support providers other than rsyslog and syslog-ng.

=== Custom Configuration:

By using an override cookbook the default configuration can be customized by replacing
the default configuration file template for the provider.

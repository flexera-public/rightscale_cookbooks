The <tt>repo_svn</tt> provider is defined in the providers/default.rb file and contains source code for the <tt>:pull</tt> and <tt>:capistrano_pull</tt> actions.
For more info about these actions please see <tt>repo</tt> cookbook's README.

The <tt>repo_svn</tt> provider allows the retrieval of source code from SVN remote repositories.
It supports repositories with public and private (username/password protected) access.

For normal operations, it requires "repo" resource, which acts as interface to all <tt>repo_svn</tt> provider logic.

===== Actions:
<tt>:pull</tt>
Standard repo pull. Pull source code from a remote repository by specifying its location with a URL.

<tt>:capistrano_pull</tt>
Perform standard pull and then a capistrano deployment style will be applied.

For usage examples, please see corresponding section in <tt>repo</tt> cookbook's README.

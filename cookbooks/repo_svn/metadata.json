See \"repo\" cookbook README for details.\n* Requires a virtual machine launched from a RightScale-managed RightImage.\n\n== COOKBOOKS DEPENDENCIES:\n\nPlease see <tt>metadata.rb</tt> file for the latest dependencies.\n\n* <tt>rightscale</tt>\n* <tt>repo</tt>\n\n== KNOWN LIMITATIONS:\n\nThere are no known limitations.\n\n== SETUP/USAGE:\n\n* Provider will be automatically initialized when you add \"repo:default\" recipe to your ServerTemplate runlist\n* Once setup, use the recipes in the 'repo' cookbook to install and manage your code repo.\n  See the 'repo' cookbook's README.rdoc for usage details.\n* Select 'repo_svn' option in repo/default/provider input.\n* To perform correct operations, values for the 'repo/url', and 'repo/branch' inputs must be provided.\n* To retrieve source code from private svn repositories you must provide values for the 'repo/default/credential' and 'repo/default/account' inputs for authentication purposes.\n\n== DETAILS:\n\n=== General\n\nThe 'repo_svn' implementation can be called with the help of the Lightweight Resource, which can be\nfound in the <tt>repo</tt> cookbook.\n\nFor more about Lightweight Resources and Providers (LWRPs), please see\n{Lightweight Resources and Providers}[http://support.rightscale.com/12-Guides/Chef_Cookbooks_Developer_Guide/08-Chef_Development/Lightweight_Resources_and_Providers_(LWRP)].\n\n=== LWRPs:\n\nThe <tt>repo_svn</tt> provider is defined in the providers/default.rb file and contains source code for the <tt>:pull</tt> and <tt>:capistrano_pull</tt> actions.\nFor more info about these actions please see <tt>repo</tt> cookbook's README.\n\nThe <tt>repo_svn</tt> provider allows the retrieval of source code from Subversion remote repositories.\nIt supports repositories with public and private (username/password protected) access.\n\nFor normal operations, it requires \"repo\" resource, which acts as interface to all <tt>repo_svn</tt> provider logic.\n\n===== Actions:\n<tt>:pull</tt>\nStandard repo pull.

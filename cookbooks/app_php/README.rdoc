= RightScale App PHP Cookbook 

== DESCRIPTION:

* Cookbook provides Apache + PHP implementation of the app LWRP.
* Installs and configures, Apache + PHP application server.

== REQUIREMENTS:
* Requires "app" LightWeight resource cookbook https://github.com/rightscale/rightscale_cookbooks/tree/master/cookbooks/app
  or your own implementation of "app" resource. See "app" cookbook readme for details.
* Requires a VM launched from a RightScale managed RightImage
* Tested on CentOS 5.6 RightImage
* Tested on Ubuntu 10.04 RightImage
* Tested on RedHat 5.8 RightImage

== COOKBOOKS DEPENDENCIES:
Please see <tt>metadata.rb</tt> file for the latest dependencies.

* <tt>rightscale</tt>
* <tt>web_apache</tt>
* <tt>repo</tt>
* <tt>db_mysql</tt>
* <tt>db_postgres</tt>
* <tt>app</tt>
* <tt>db</tt>

== KNOWN LIMITATIONS:
 Currently apache uses a static configuration and makes no tuning changes for resources available on larger instances.
 However, configuration can be overwritten using cookbook override techniques. See cookbooks_override project at: https://github.com/ekargard/cookbooks_override/tree/master/cookbooks

== SETUP/USAGE:

* Place app_php::default recipe into your runlist to setup the application
  server. Since this sets up the app provider, it must be run before the
  app::default recipe (which expects a provider to already be set).
* When using a RightScale ServerTemplate, this will also automatically add the
  common attributes to your ServerTemplate inputs.

==== rightscale_server_collection

The server collection resource finds a set of servers in a deployment with a set
of tags. The <tt>tags</tt> attribute specifies the tag or tags to search for (if
multiple tags are specified, servers with any of the tags will match) and the
optional <tt>secondary_tags</tt> attribute specifies tags that need to also
appear on the servers, it will wait one minute for the <tt>secondary_tags</tt>
to appear, which can be overridden with the <tt>timeout</tt> attribute.

Syntax:

  rightscale_server_collection "rightscale_servers" do
    tags "rs_login:state=active"
    secondary_tags "server:uuid=*"
  end
